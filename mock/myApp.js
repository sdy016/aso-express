      "New updates introduced a lot of bugs. The game play was never completely seamless, but it had never been this bad. Since the latest update, the game freezes mid battle and then suddenly it catches up and my character is dead or something else significant has happened. Before the creators say anything, this is NOT an internet connection issue. This is an issue with the game. I'm actually considering uninstalling after 2+ years because these bugs have taken a lot of fun away from playing it.",
      "Good game, really fun but takes a lot of learning up front. It pays off once you've leveled up enough and have competent characters on your roster. Only problems are that it's really unbalanced and kinda pay to win, and it's a pretty buggy game. I have a brand new s22+ but it still always crashes... Still a must play if you're a fan of one piece though.",
      "It's a fun game, the controls are good, graphics are good, but I only give it 3 stars cause they put u against players that are way to strong and the only way to level up is to beat those players. so it's way to hard to level up a character without spending money. I think they should make it easier to level up characters, they should make it where you only have to get like 50 fragments to level up not 500, and it's all random when you can exchange points for fragments. It's a pay to win game.",
      'At first i didnt really like it, but after a couple battles its started growing on me! Its a very fun game. You collect and upgrade characters, and it has characters other than the strawhats or pirates! (which makes it way more interesting lol) Overall the game is really fun and i reccomend it! It does have some spoilers with character designs and moves but not really anything else! (From where i am haha)',
      'Third update. This game, if you put the investment in it, has a lot of replay value and fun hidden inside. It also has constant character changes and updates to improve the game so it never gets too stale. Definitely recommend to One piece fans who are itching to enjoy playing as their favorite characters. The roster is huge and still expanding.',

      "The game is fun for the model that it's been and it works. The only thing that would help game would be the stability of the game. Sometimes, just trying to start a quest or even upgrade a character, the game will crash. In the past, the game didn't have that as a big issue. So please improve the loading stability of game screen transitions and just the game overall.",
      "The game seems like it's good but if only I could play it Currently I'm dealing with an accruing problem where the game won't even load after tapping the icon it just stays on a black screen. I even checked to see if my device was capable of running the game an it says that it can do idk what the problem is. I'm not going to assume anything but if this is an accruing bug please fix this. Thank you.",
      "I love this game. Even though there are way too many loading screens, some time even when I have great connections it will tell me to retry or title screen, I wish this was on console, and there are some characters they are missing. But other than that it's a good start for when they do make one for console these little problems while be solved.",
      'Good game overall. It does well in a lot of places such as the amount of story available, to the character designs, to the fact that they are constantly adding new things to do. Their only problem is the drop rates for certain items or characters, even in quest where they are more easily attainable they are still hard to obtain. This also includes character pulling events.',
      "I absolutely LOVE this game. I just recently got back into Bleach and it captures some of the anime's moments perfectly. The pull rate for characters can be just a little iffy sometimes, but it's certainly better than many summon systems I've seen in games. The special moves are wonderfully animated and an absolute treat to watch. All in all, it's been a great game for the year I've had it on my phone and I don't see myself putting it down anytime soon.",
